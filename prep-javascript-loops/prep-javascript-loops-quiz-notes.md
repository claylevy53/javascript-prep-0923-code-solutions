## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?

  To tell the code when to stop the loop, if this condition is met the code will stop running and the condition will become false.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?

  It is evaluated once at the very beginning, before the loop starts executing. This initialization step typically involves setting up an initial value for the loop control variable

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?

  After each iteration of the loop has completed the **condition** will be evvaulted again if it is true, ending the loop if it is false.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?

  The third expression, the **final expression** is evaluated after the end of each iteration of the loop, just before the loop checks the condition for the next iteration

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?

  The **final expression** serves the purpose of updating the loop control variable after each iteration of the loop. This expression allows you to control the progression of the loop, specifying how the loop variable should change with each iteration

- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?

  Primarily for in loops are used for iterating over the properties of objects
